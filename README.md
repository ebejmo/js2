# js2-ca

## Noroff Social
This repository picks up where we left of the css-frameworks-ca. This front-end application is adding some functionality to the old project. The goal of the project is to apply JavaScript techniques to implement front-end functionality for a social media application, including viewing, posting, editing, and deleting social media content.

The client application is designed to be attractive and responsive, and the code is based on the provided API and API documentation. The application supports various user stories, such as user registration, login, viewing and interacting with post content feeds. There is still plenty of work to be done, code can be less repetitive and the UI can give better feedback.
